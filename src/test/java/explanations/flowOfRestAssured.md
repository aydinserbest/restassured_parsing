Explanation of JSON Parsing and Validation with REST Assured and JsonPath

We send an HTTP request using REST Assured and receive a response from the server. 
By parsing this response using the JsonPath library, 
we can access specific fields within the JSON and validate their values. 
The purpose of this process is to make the data in the JSON response usable by the program 
and to validate these data points.

Detailed Steps:
Sending an HTTP Request:  We use REST Assured to send an HTTP request (typically GET, POST, etc.).
Receiving the Response:  We receive the response from the server. This response can be in JSON format.
Parsing the JSON:  We parse the response using JsonPath. This makes the JSON data usable by the program.
Accessing Specific Fields:  We access specific fields within the JSON using JsonPath.
Validation (Assertion):  We check if the retrieved values are equal to the expected values.

Example Test:

    public class RetrieveResponse {
    String jsonEndpoint = "https://testpages.herokuapp.com/apps/mocktracks/projectsjson.php";
    
        @Test
        public void testJsonPathParsingAndAssertion() {
            // 1. Send an HTTP GET request
            Response response = RestAssured.when().get(jsonEndpoint);
    
            // 2. Parse the response using JsonPath
            JsonPath jsonPath = response.jsonPath();
    
            // 3. Access a specific field (projects.project[0].name)
            String projectName = jsonPath.getString("projects.project[0].name");
    
            // 4. Validate that the obtained value equals the expected value
            assertThat(projectName, equalTo("A New Projectaniheeiadtatd"));
        }
    }
Explanation:
1-Sending an HTTP Request:

    Response response = RestAssured.when().get(jsonEndpoint);
We use REST Assured to send a GET request to the specified URL and receive the response as a Response object.

2-Receiving the Response and Parsing the JSON:

    JsonPath jsonPath = response.jsonPath();
We parse the received response using the JsonPath object. 
This indicates that the response is in JSON format and is now processable using JsonPath.

3-Accessing Specific Fields:

    String projectName = jsonPath.getString("projects.project[0].name");
We use the JsonPath object to access a specific field within the JSON. 
In this example, we access the name field of the first project.

4-Validation (Assertion):

    assertThat(projectName, equalTo("A New Projectaniheeiadtatd"));
We check if the obtained value (projectName) equals the expected value using the assertThat method from the Hamcrest library.

Summary:
Send an HTTP Request:       We send an HTTP request using REST Assured.
Receive the Response:       We receive the response from the server.
Parse the JSON:             We parse the response using JsonPath.
Access Specific Fields:     We access specific fields within the JSON using the JsonPath object.
Validate Values:            We validate the values of these fields using assertions.
These steps make it easy to retrieve, process, and validate JSON data from an API response. 
The goal is to make the data in the JSON response usable and to validate these data points.
