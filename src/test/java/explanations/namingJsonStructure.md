Naming the JSON Structure
Example 1
Given JSON structure:

    {
    "courses": {
    "project": [
    {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "A New Project"
    },
    {
    "id": 3,
    "name": "the new name"
    }
    ]
    },
    "projects": {
    ...
    },
    "instructor": "RahulShetty"
    }
In this structure, the naming is as follows:

An object named "courses" exists.
An array named "project" exists.

Example 2
Given JSON structure:

    {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "A New Project"
    }
In this structure, the naming is as follows:

Root Object: This JSON structure itself is the root object.
A key named "id" and its value exist.
A key named "name" and its value exist.

Explanation in Terms of Naming
Root Object: 
The top-level object of the JSON data. In this example, { "id": 1, "name": "A New Project" } is 
the root object.
"id" Key: This key has a value of 1.
"name" Key: This key has a value of "A New Project".
By naming each part of the JSON structure and the key-value pairs, you can explain the structure clearly. 
In summary, the root object is the top-level structure, 
and the keys and their values define the content of this object.
