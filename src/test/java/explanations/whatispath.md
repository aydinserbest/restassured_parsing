Definition and Usage of Path
Path: A path is an addressing method used to access a specific key or value within a JSON structure. 
It follows a hierarchical structure of the JSON data 
and is used in JSONPath expressions to specify the location of the data you want to retrieve.

Role of Path and Examples

            {
    "proje": {
    "detaylar": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Bir Proje"
    }
    }
    }


JSONPath expression: proje.detaylar.id
Path: "proje.detaylar.id" expression follows the hierarchical structure within the JSON to access the "id" key.

Example Usages
Example 1: Simple JSON Structure

    {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "A Project"
    }
Path Usage:

    JsonPath jsonPath = new JsonPath(jsonExample);
    String idValue = jsonPath.getString("id"); // Path: "id"
    String nameValue = jsonPath.getString("name"); // Path: "name"
Explanation:

Path: "id" and "name"
These paths directly access the "id" and "name" keys at the root level of the JSON.

Example 2: Nested JSON Structure

    {
    "project": {
    "details": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "A Project"
    }
    }
    }
Path Usage:

    JsonPath jsonPath = new JsonPath(jsonExample);
    String idValue = jsonPath.getString("project.details.id"); // Path: "project.details.id"
    String nameValue = jsonPath.getString("project.details.name"); // Path: "project.details.name"
Explanation:

Path: "project.details.id" and "project.details.name"
These paths follow the hierarchy within the JSON to access the "id" and "name" keys under "project" and "details".

Example 3: JSON Structure with Array

    {
    "employees": [
    {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Ali"
    },
    {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Ay≈üe"
    }
    ]
    }
Path Usage:

    JsonPath jsonPath = new JsonPath(jsonExample);
    int firstEmployeeId = jsonPath.getInt("employees[0].id"); // Path: "employees[0].id"
    String secondEmployeeName = jsonPath.getString("employees[1].name"); // Path: "employees[1].name"
Explanation:

Path: "employees[0].id" and "employees[1].name"

These paths access specific elements within the array and their keys.

Conclusion
A path is an expression used to access a specific key or value within a JSON structure. 
It follows the hierarchical structure of the JSON data and is specified in JSONPath expressions 
to retrieve specific parts of the data. 
The path represents the hierarchy within the JSON and allows easy access 
to the desired data by following the specified address within the JSON structure.

### sentence examples related to the "PATH"

JSONPath provides access to data within JSON using a specific path, which greatly facilitates API testing.
