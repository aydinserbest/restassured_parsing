Let's explain the statement assertTrue(launchYear.matches("\\d{4}")); in detail.

launchYear.matches("\\d{4}") Expression
This expression checks if the launchYear variable matches a specific regular expression (regex). 
Let's break it down step by step:

launchYear:
launchYear is a variable of type String. It contains the value represented by the launch_year key in the JSON data.
matches Method:
The matches method checks if a String object matches the specified regular expression (regex).
If the launchYear variable matches the specified regex, the matches method returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
Regular Expression (Regex): \\d{4}:
\\d represents a digit (any number from 0 to 9).
{4} indicates that the preceding character (a digit) must occur 4 times.
Therefore, \\d{4} means "a four-digit number."
The double backslash (\\) is used to escape the backslash character in Java, 
which is necessary because a single \d would cause a syntax error. 
Thus, \\d is used to correctly represent a digit in the regex.
This regex checks if the launchYear value is a four-digit number (e.g., 2006, 2020).

assertTrue Statement
The assertTrue method is an assertion method in the JUnit testing library. 
It checks if the passed expression is true. If the expression is true, the test passes; 
if it is false, the test fails and throws an error.

Example Usage
For example, if the launch_year value in the JSON data is "2006":

    String launchYear = "2006";
    assertTrue(launchYear.matches("\\d{4}")); // This statement will return true.
    If the launch_year value is "06" or "2006a", which are not four-digit numbers:

    String launchYear = "06";
    assertTrue(launchYear.matches("\\d{4}")); // This statement will return false and the test will fail.

Reviewing the Code

    @Test
    public void testLaunchDataValues() {
    List<Map<String, Object>> list = RestAssured.when().get(endpoint).jsonPath().getList("");
    for (Map<String, Object> launch : list) {
    int flightNumber = (int) launch.get("flight_number");
    assertTrue(flightNumber > 0);
    
            String launchYear = (String) launch.get("launch_year");
            assertTrue(launchYear.matches("\\d{4}"));
    
            Boolean launchSuccess = (Boolean) launch.get("launch_success");
            Map<String, Object> failureDetails = (Map<String, Object>) launch.get("launch_failure_details");
            if (launchSuccess != null && launchSuccess) {
                assertNull(failureDetails);
            }
        }
    }
In this code snippet:

We check if the launch_year value is a four-digit number.
This ensures that the year value in the JSON data is in the correct format.
